For initial validation problem and enabling : 
	-In .NET 4.5 the Validators use data-attributes and bounded Javascript to do the validation work, so .NET expects you to add a script reference for jQuery.   
	<appSettings>
      		<add key="ValidationSettings:UnobtrusiveValidationMode" value="None" />
	</appSettings>
