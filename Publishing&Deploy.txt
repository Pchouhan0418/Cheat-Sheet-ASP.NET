<=======Domain,Hosting,Web Server Concept======>

1.Domain :
	-Your address name like http://www.something.com

2.Web Server :
	-Web server is a computer program that upon the request from a web browser, it delivers Web pages to a user’s computer.
	-It can be either a software or a hardware.
	-In other words, Web servers are computers that deliver (serves up) Web pages.  (Ex:IIS,XAMP)
	-I can aslo use my pc as web server which can use everyone.But i have to run my pc app all the time.Besides it will slow down as ip is changes and so on

3.Web Hosting : 
	-Web host is a company or person that host your content on their server they have also web server.They give you a control panel.
	-It also uses web server.
	-"Shared hosting is using share with your hosting with others"

/*===================================*/
<=======Website,Webapplication on (asp.net)======>

4.Websites :
	-It can be static or dynamic page(using php,asp.net and so on)
	-It is used when you have limited edition of control such as one page to another pr show or retrive information in a small way 
	-It uploaded the webserver in every page by page and expose the code and easily editable by replacing that individual code.
	-It compile on the server dynamically which may take time consuming.
	-It can have more language (VB.net,c#) which include in app_data

5.Webapplication :
	-It us use for many control such as button textbox where the tamplate are often same(facebook,online mifrosoft word etc.).
	-If some changes then you have to change the overall webserver file.
	-Good for unit testing
	-Web application need to be fully complied before running so there will be no chance of getting any unknow complilation error,in website it can be possible.
	-Web application are always better than the Web Sites. they provide better solution than web site.
	-It have more features than website (don't support)
	"If you are developing in a small way then develop in websites otherwise develop webapplication"

	<#Key Points#>
        You need to migrate large Visual Studio .NET 2003 applications to VS 2005? use the Web Application project.
        You want to open and edit any directory as a Web project without creating a project file? use Web Site project.
        You need to add pre-build and post-build steps during compilation? use Web Application project.
        You need to build a Web application using multiple Web projects? use Web Application project.
        You want to generate one assembly for each page? use Web Site project.
        You prefer dynamic compilation and working on pages without building entire site on each page view? use Web Site project.
        You prefer single-page code model to code-behind model? use Web Site project.
	(Some coding errors are found in Web Applications at compile time that are not found in Web Sites until run time.)
	<#============#>
If you are doing n-tier development, I highly recommend the web application model. If you are doing a limited web site or a quick and dirty implementation, the web site model may have advantages.

<=======Deployment,Publishing======>

6.Deployment :
	-Deployment means you set up your asp.net web application to the server where u need to host it.(Either copying all files )
	-Deployment is creating an executable from the desired Framework and you need to move the exe to the server then you can install the executable.
	-In other word you can deploy your projcet for using 
7.Publishing :
	-publish a website is just a method of deployment which is more secure as aspx pages are precompiled and this gives a bit of security and perfomance over deploying plain aspx pages
	-Publish is just direct way to deploy the web site or a project to the server using FTP or other 	
	-publish for everyone where everyone can use it without knowing all the details of backgroung and install it and carry it(pendrive)
