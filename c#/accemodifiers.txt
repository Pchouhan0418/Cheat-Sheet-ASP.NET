   private
	-The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct.
   protected
	-The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class, or in a class that is derived from that class.
   internal
 	-The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly.

   protected internal The type or member can be accessed by any code in the assembly in which it is declared, or from within a derived class in another assembly.
